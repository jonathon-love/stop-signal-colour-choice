<p>As last time, on some trials the grey border will appear</p>
<div class="cc" width="300" height="300"></div>
<p><strong>This time, when the border appears try <u>not</u> to respond</strong></p>
<p>Do not wait for the border, or slow your responding to the dots, but when you see the border
try and halt your response. Sometimes the border will come too late for you to halt your response,
and this is ok. Accurate and fast responding to the dots is more important.
